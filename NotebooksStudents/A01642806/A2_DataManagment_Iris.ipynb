The **Pandas** library was developed to meet this need. **Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course. **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n","\n","The main data structure that **Pandas** works with is called a **Data Frame**. This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically\n","represent cases and the columns represent variables (e.g. data used in this tutorial).  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n","\n","Pandas has a variety of functions named `read_xxx` for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading `csv` files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include `excel`, `json`, and `sql`.\n","\n","There are many other options to `read_csv` that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for `read_csv`.\n","\n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","- The dataset used in this tutorial is from https://www.coursera.org/ from the course \"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python\" by University of Michigan\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b9FN-daXhjjT"},"source":["# Importing libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uRwVhX-YhjjU"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the packages that we will be using\n","import pandas as pd                 # For data handling\n","\n","#pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 100) # Show all columns when looking at dataframe"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MbGKgakihjjg"},"source":["# Importing data"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define where you are running the code: colab or local\n","RunInColab          = True     # (False: no  | True: yes)\n","\n","# If running in colab:\n","if RunInColab:\n","    # Mount your google drive in google colab\n","    from google.colab import drive\n","    drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","    # Find location\n","    #!pwd\n","    #!ls\n","    #!ls \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    Ruta            = \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","else:\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    Ruta            = \"\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tNHPKB8pbRRC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710987856612,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":22606,"user":{"displayName":"Diego Alejandro Calvario Aceves","userId":"11179083752310400875"}},"outputId":"75f0b2ab-1906-4965-ec4e-e5a0265ac94b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DXHHhj2jhjjg"},"outputs":[],"source":["# url string that hosts our .csv file\n","url = Ruta + \"datasets/iris/iris.csv\"\n","\n","# Read the .csv file and store it as a pandas Data Frame\n","column_names = [\"sepallength\",\"sepalwidth\", \"petallength\", \"petalwidth\",\"flowername\"]\n","df = pd.read_csv(url,header=None, names = column_names)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E2PGATdIbINm"},"source":["If we want to print the information about th output object type we would simply type the following:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"MWbb703QbINn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710987858811,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":226,"user":{"displayName":"Diego Alejandro Calvario Aceves","userId":"11179083752310400875"}},"outputId":"a59b1bac-d5c7-4b52-a485-04929bfd7436"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["pandas.core.frame.DataFrame"],"text/html":["<div style=\"max-width:800px; border: 1px solid var(--colab-border-color);\"><style>\n","      pre.function-repr-contents {\n","        overflow-x: auto;\n","        padding: 8px 12px;\n","        max-height: 500px;\n","      }\n","\n","      pre.function-repr-contents.function-repr-contents-collapsed {\n","        cursor: pointer;\n","        max-height: 100px;\n","      }\n","    </style>\n","    <pre style=\"white-space: initial; background:\n","         var(--colab-secondary-surface-color); padding: 8px 12px;\n","         border-bottom: 1px solid var(--colab-border-color);\"><b>pandas.core.frame.DataFrame</b><br/>def __init__(data=None, index: Axes | None=None, columns: Axes | None=None, dtype: Dtype | None=None, copy: bool | None=None) -&gt; None</pre><pre class=\"function-repr-contents function-repr-contents-collapsed\" style=\"\"><a class=\"filepath\" style=\"display:none\" href=\"#\">/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/frame.py</a>Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data.\n","\n","Data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns).\n","Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels.
