The **Pandas** library was developed to meet this need. **Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course. **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n","\n","The main data structure that **Pandas** works with is called a **Data Frame**. This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically\n","represent cases and the columns represent variables (e.g. data used in this tutorial).  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n","\n","Pandas has a variety of functions named `read_xxx` for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading `csv` files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include `excel`, `json`, and `sql`.\n","\n","There are many other options to `read_csv` that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for `read_csv`.\n","\n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","- The dataset used in this tutorial is from https://www.coursera.org/ from the course \"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python\" by University of Michigan\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b9FN-daXhjjT"},"source":["# Importing libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":65,"metadata":{"id":"uRwVhX-YhjjU"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the packages that we will be using\n","import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":66,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn import datasets\n","iris = datasets.load_iris()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":67,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["   sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width       Flower\n","0           5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","1           4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","2           4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","3           4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","4           5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2  Iris-setosa\n"]}],"source":["# Define the col names for the iris dataset\n","col_names = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'Flower']\n","\n","# Dataset url\n","url = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data\"\n","\n","# Load the dataset from URL\n","iris_df = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=col_names)\n","print(iris_df.head())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MbGKgakihjjg"},"source":["# Importing data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hkKl8GApcJwL"},"source":["If we want to print the information about th output object type we would simply type the following: type(iris_df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":68,"metadata":{"id":"lBSUFAZ7cJwM"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["pandas.core.frame.DataFrame"]},"execution_count":68,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["type(iris_df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-TrO3YWShjjl"},"source":["# Exploring the content of the data set\n","\n","Use the `shape` method to determine the numbers of rows and columns in a data frame.
